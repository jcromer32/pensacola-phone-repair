# README
This is my first Rails project. I am creating a site for a [Local Pensacola Phone Repair Shop](http://www.cellphonerepairpcola.com) and I hope I'll be able to create something good with Ruby on Rails.

My experience with Rails is not nearly as extensive as my experience in working with phone repair near me. For some reason, I personally know almost every phone repair store in the Pensacola area. 

So, back to the technical side. Normally, I would build a site for a local phone repair shop in Wordpress. But I really want to try the ability for a Ruby on Rails site to index in the search engines. I have been very fortunate to work on many other websites and increase their search engine visibility. 

I've been working with a local phone repair tech for several months and I've gotten him a ton of leads. Most from Google's organic search results. And with the organic results, I've learned that the two most important phrases to rank are [iPhone repair Pensacola](http://www.cellphonerepairpcola.com) and "phone repair pensacola."
